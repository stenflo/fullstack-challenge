# fullstack-challenge

### The problem (as originally stated in the challenge):

Build a combined order book that takes the full order books from Bittrex and Poloniex for the BTC_ETH
market and displays them in a way that shows combined volume at each price point.
Other considerations:
Please complete the challenge in Nodejs
Clearly label which is ask book and which is the bids book
Clearly label which exchange has order volume at each price point
Please host a demo of the code running online (free heroku site or similar)

### Extra points for:

More exchanges
Allow user to switch to different markets (the BTC_DOGE market for example)
Highlight if the books overlap (ie bids on Bittrex overlap with asks on Poloniex)
Actively updating the combined order book based on actual trades from the exchanges
Unit Tests

### Notes

This projects has two separate modules, the client and the server,
respectively. Please build them individually, each with NPM.
